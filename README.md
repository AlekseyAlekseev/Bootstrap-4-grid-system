##What's not included:
Pretty much everything else. It's really up to you. No styles, no javascript - not even a CSS reset.

##Notes
Thanks to Bootstrap team, it's all their work. While making this respository i had to read every line of code, and i  relaized how genious bootstrap's grid system is, no wonder it's so popular. I would suggest everyone go through it, it's totally worth it!
